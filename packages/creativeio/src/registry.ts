 * Server-safe catalog: metadata only, no component references. Published as

 * Components (Next.js App Router and friends) can list every component
 * without pulling in react-three-fiber/three — those only load once you
 * actually render a component client-side via the main entry.
 *
 * Adding a new component means adding its info import + array entry here,
 * and a re-export in index.ts — nothing else in this file changes.
